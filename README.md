Feedforward Sequential Memory Networks

PyTorch implementations for FSMN (Feedforward Sequential Memory Networks), cFSMN (Compact FSMN), DFSMN (Deep-FSMN).
Still in development (It will be implemented in two ways: linear product and conv1d.).

The code is modified from [tensorflow](https://github.com/katsugeneration/tensor-fsmn) version.
